# hello-world

Hi geeks!

Skylet1013 here (I know this is a puerile name, but I've been using it since long before GitHub was founded). I'm a former publicist and casual teacher looking to find a new career path in coding or CAD. I like reading, history, gaming and collecting toys. I have a dog and some parrots.
